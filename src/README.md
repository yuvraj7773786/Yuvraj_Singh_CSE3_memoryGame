🌟 Memory Game Task Planner and Algorithms

-> Screens:
1) Start screen ✅
2) Game screen

-> Start screen:
1) Has a card ✅
2) Card has a "select theme" option ✅
3) Card has a "number of players" option ✅
4) Card has a "grid size" option ✅
5) Card has a "start game" button ✅

-> Game screen:
1) Has a heading on left ✅
2) Has a pair of buttons on right ("Restart" and "New Game") ✅
3) Has the main grid of circles ✅
4) Has a timer + moves or number of players count ✅
5) Has a dialog with end results (different for single and multi player modes)

-> Icons chosen:

Boat, Cable-car, Cat, Cake, Cone, Dice, Dragon, Flask, Fork, Fox, Gamepad, Ghost,
Infinite, Lemon, Masks, Snowflake, TV, Umbrella

-> Grid of circles:
1) Can be a 4x4 or 6x6 grid ✅
2) Can be numbers or icons ✅
3) Consists of elements (numbers or icons) in pairs ✅
4) All the elements should be randomly ordered ✅

⭐️ Algorithm used for shuffle - Modern version of Fisher-Yates

Logic behind the grid circles ->
1) Should have a "found tiles" collections for tiles successfully found ✅
2) Temporarily save 2 tiles for comparison ✅
3) If the two tiles match (not the same tile clicked twice), move them to found tiles ✅
4) Else clear out the 2 temporarily saved tiles ✅

Logic behind the timer ->
1) Values should be string ✅
2) Timer state object should have a minute and a second value ✅
3) Should begin counting once the game begins ✅
4) If seconds are 59, reset seconds to 0, and increment minutes by 1 ✅
5) If minutes are less than 10, add a zero before them ✅
6) If seconds are less than 10, add a zero before them ✅
7) Return updated minutes and seconds ✅

Logic behind multiplayer ->
1) For multiplayer, no timer should be set
2) Assign an id and score to the number of players ✅
3) Chance to play starts from 1 to n and then repeat once nth player had their chance ✅
4) Player that successfully matches a pair gets an additional chance to play ✅
5) Player that fails to match a pair gets one chance only ✅
6) After the player has played their chance, the next player in line gets the chance to play ✅
7) The player with the most successful matches wins
8) Draw is also possible

Logic behind game over dialog ->
1) 

Extras -

1) Can have an indication for when the game begins
2) Should end the game if the player takes too long (longer than 10 minutes)
